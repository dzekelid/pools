  title: SendGrid Add Ips Pools
  description: |-
    **This endpoint allows you to create an IP pool.**

    **Each user can create up to 10 different IP pools.**

    IP Pools allow you to group your dedicated SendGrid IP addresses together. For example, you could create separate pools for your transactional and marketing email. When sending marketing emails, specify that you want to use the marketing IP pool. This allows you to maintain separate reputations for your different email traffic.

    IP pools can only be used with whitelabeled IP addresses.

    If an IP pool is NOT specified for an email, it will use any IP available, including ones in pools.
